    "1. **(2 points)** Implement on a language of your choice a function that calculates a continuous approximation of the grade of this course (grading rules given in the first lecture). That is, the function takes as input the number of points received in the course and the maximal number of points and gives as output a value so that the integer part of that is the grade. \n",
